\section{LIFETIME ESTIMATION}
\label{sec:lt_estimation}
In this section, we propose a method to estimate the lifetime interval of attacked designs, considering the workload variations based on the aforementioned assumption and definition of critical operational mode.

Based on the assumption, the union of critical operational modes of all candidate paths is equivalent to the universal set of operational modes, i.e., all operational modes. Thus, for the purpose of covering all operational modes, we have to consider the severe aging condition of each candidate path, such that the associated critical operational modes are applied to predict the lifetime of other paths using a binary search method.

For example, given the candidate path $i$, the other path $j$, and time variable $t$, the goal of the method is to predict $j's$ lifetime by binarily searching toward a convergent $t$. That is, during the binary search, the timing variable $t$ will be iteratively calibrated according to the $j's$ setup timing constraint, formulated in Equation~(\ref{eq:setup}), and eventually $j's$ lifetime will converge toward the value of $t$. Where $j's$ aging rate is derived by the aging correlation between $i$ and $j$ (i.e., regression equation of $i$ on $j$) and $i's$ aging rate is derived from Equation~(\ref{eq:worst}). 
As a result, when $i$ is considered undergoing severe aging, we can obtain the other paths' lifetimes, among which we choose the smallest one as the lifetime of the attacked design.

In accordance with the former procedure, we can derive one lifetime value of a path being compromised with malicious aging. By considering all candidate paths undergoing severe aging, we can derive a group of lifetime values, among which smallest one and biggest one are the resulting interval based on the attack.

\section{LIFETIME AND PROBABILITY ESTIMATION}
\label{sec:lt_estimation}
In this section, we propose a method to estimate the lifetime intervals of attacked designs. Then, the resulting intervals are used to further estimate the probabilities that the attacked designs fail within the desired lifetime interval $[n-\varepsilon, n+\varepsilon]$.
\subsection{Estimation of the Lifetime Interval of Attacked Design}
Based on the assumption, the union of critical operational modes of all candidate paths is equivalent to the universal set of operational modes, i.e., all operational modes. Thus, for the purpose of covering all operational modes, we have to consider the severe aging condition of each candidate path, such that the associated critical operational modes are applied to predict the lifetime of other paths using a binary search method.

For example, given the candidate path $i$, the other path $j$, and time variable $t$, the goal of the method is to predict $j's$ lifetime by binarily searching toward a convergent $t$. That is, during the binary search, the timing variable $t$ will be iteratively calibrated according to the $j's$ setup timing constraint, formulated in Equation~(\ref{eq:setup}), and eventually $j's$ lifetime will converge toward the value of $t$. Where $j's$ aging rate is derived by the aging correlation between $i$ and $j$ (i.e., regression equation of $i$ on $j$) and $i's$ aging rate is derived from Equation~(\ref{eq:worst}). 
As a result, when $i$ is considered undergoing severe aging, we can obtain the other paths' lifetimes, among which we choose the smallest one as the lifetime of the attacked design.

In accordance with the former procedure, we can derive one lifetime value of a path being compromised with malicious aging. By considering all candidate paths undergoing severe aging, we can derive a group of lifetime values, among which smallest one and biggest one are the resulting interval based on the attack.
\subsection{Estimation of the Probability that Attacked Design Fails in Desired Lifetime Interval}
The resulting lifetime interval consists of lower bound and upper bound, indicating the earliest and the latest fail time point, respectively, whereas the exact fail time point depends on users' workload. Consequently, we assume that, the probabilities of time points when the attacked design fails are normally distributed within the resulting lifetime interval. In this way, we can derive the \textit{PDF (Probability Density Function)} of time points. Then, the total probabilities that the attacked design fails within $[n-\varepsilon, n+\varepsilon]$ can be calculated from the following equation:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:pdf}
		P_{T} = \int_{n-\varepsilon}^{n+\varepsilon} f_{PDF}(t) \,\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
where $P_{T}$ denotes the total probabilities, $t$ is the time variable of probability density function $f_{PDF}(t)$
