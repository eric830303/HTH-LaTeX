\label{sec:lt_estimation}
%-------------------------- Paragraph --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this section, we propose a methodology to estimate the lifetime interval of attacked designs, considering the workload variations. 

It is worth reminding the previous corollary: The union of critical operational modes of all candidate paths is equivalent to the universe of operational modes. That is, after applying worst-case aging on each candidate path, all operational modes are considered, during the lifetime estimation in our methodology.
